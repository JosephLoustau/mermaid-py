# Graph module

This module provides the `Graph` base class for creating and manipulating different types of diagrams such as flowcharts, ER diagrams, etc.

## Classes

### Graph

Represents a base class for different types of diagrams.

#### Attributes

- `script` (str): The main script to create the diagram.

#### Methods

- `save(path: Optional[Path] = None) -> None`: Saves the diagram to a file. If `path` is not provided, the diagram will be saved in the current directory with the title as the filename. The file extension must be either `.mmd` or `.mermaid`.
- `_build_script() -> None`: Builds the script for the diagram by adding a YAML front matter with the title.

```
